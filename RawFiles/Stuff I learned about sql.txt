Stuff I learned about sql

- INSERT EXEC is wacky and stupid
	- https://www.sommarskog.se/share_data.html#INSERTEXEC
- Dynamic sql
	- Create sql code using sql code
	- Can be useful to generate crazy where clauses
	- It's problematic if you want to access variables you declared above it
- I converted 9 ethnicity true false columns into a single binary number
	- That way I didn't have to use Dynamic sql
	- Much simpler where clause
